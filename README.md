# hello-world
Hello everyone! Lets learn together at SocratiQ and start our explorations!
My name is Jaza Mahajan. 
I am currently in my third year of doing Bachelors in English Literature from Delhi University.
I am born and broughtup in Delhi but originally I am from Kashmir. 
My main interests are painting and getting closer to my religion 
Recently, I have started enjoying using oil pastels too. Earlier, I was afraid of using them since it sometimes messes up and gets dirty everywhere, but now I have started being more patient with them, lol.
